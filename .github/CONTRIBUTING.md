# Contributing to ROOTED

ROOTED is a **law-governed civic platform**.

This is not a typical startup codebase.
This is not feature-first software.

By contributing, you agree that:
- governance overrides convenience
- safety overrides growth
- child protection overrides all other concerns

---

## 1️⃣ Governance Comes First (Non-Negotiable)

ROOTED is governed by written law committed to GitHub.

You may **not**:
- bypass governance files
- introduce silent policy changes
- add hidden privilege or access paths
- weaken Kids Mode protections
- weaken sanctuary or nonprofit restrictions
- add profiling, tracking, or demographic inference

If a rule is not written in GitHub governance files, it has **no authority**.

---

## 2️⃣ Supreme Child Safety Rule

Children are never:
- monetized
- messaged
- profiled
- tracked
- exposed to ads
- exposed to fundraising or commerce
- used for analytics segmentation

Kids Mode is:
- mandatory
- non-cosmetic
- non-overridable

Any change that risks child safety must be stopped immediately.

## 3️⃣ How to Contribute (Required Process)

### Branching
- Create a branch from `main`.
- Do not push directly to `main` unless explicitly permitted.

### Pull Requests
All changes must go through a pull request.

Your PR must clearly state:
- what changed
- why it changed
- what governance files authorize it
- any risk to safety, privacy, or trust

If governance, permissions, or safety are touched:
- explicitly reference the governing documents
- expect heightened review

---

## 4️⃣ What Requires Extra Review

These changes require special scrutiny:
- Kids Mode logic
- moderation or reporting systems
- permissions or role handling
- data access or visibility
- discovery or ranking behavior
- monetization or payments
- analytics, telemetry, or tracking
- admin tooling or overrides
- feature flags affecting safety

---

## 5️⃣ What Is Not Allowed

You may NOT:
- add profiling by identity or belief
- infer culture, religion, politics, or demographics
- add hidden analytics or tracking
- override moderation outcomes silently
- create shadow admin powers
- weaken audit logs
- treat ROOTED as a growth-hack or ad platform

---

## 6️⃣ Code & Design Expectations

- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- No “temporary” bypasses.
- No undocumented behavior.
- UI must never be the sole enforcement layer.
- Database and policy enforcement must remain authoritative.

---

## 7️⃣ Secrets & Credentials

- Never commit secrets.
- Never post keys or tokens in issues or PRs.
- Use approved secret storage mechanisms.
- Report suspected leaks immediately (see `SECURITY.md`).

---

## 8️⃣ Final Statement

ROOTED exists to serve:
- communities
- families
- children
- educators
- volunteers
- public trust

If your contribution does not align with these principles,
**you must not contribute to this platform**.
