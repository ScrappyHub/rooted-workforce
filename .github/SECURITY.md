# Security Policy — ROOTED

ROOTED is a governed civic platform designed to protect:
- children and families
- community trust
- data sovereignty
- non-commercial public spaces
- auditability and safety-first enforcement

Security issues include any vulnerability that could compromise:
- Kids Mode safety
- user privacy or consent
- role or permission boundaries
- data access controls
- moderation or audit integrity
- sanctuary and nonprofit protections
- governance enforcement (GitHub, database, admin tooling)

---

## Supported Versions

Security fixes apply to:
- the default branch (`main`)
- any active production branches

Archived or deprecated repositories must be clearly marked as such.

---

## Reporting a Security Issue (PRIVATE ONLY)

**Do NOT open public issues for security-sensitive matters.**

Use one of the following private channels:
- GitHub **Security Advisories** for this repository (preferred)
- Direct contact with the maintainer listed in `CODEOWNERS`

When reporting, include:
- a clear description of the issue
- what could be exposed or bypassed
- steps to reproduce (if safe)
- affected files or systems
- any suggested mitigation (optional)

---

## Child Safety & Trust Escalation

Any issue that could affect:
- children
- Kids Mode enforcement
- youth exposure to commerce, messaging, or data
- moderation or reporting systems

must be treated as **HIGH PRIORITY** and escalated immediately.

---

## Coordinated Disclosure

- Reports will be acknowledged as soon as possible.
- Issues will be triaged based on safety and impact.
- Fixes will be reviewed and merged through governed pull requests.
- Public disclosure (if any) occurs **only after** mitigation.

---

## Out of Scope

Unless they demonstrate real impact, the following are generally out of scope:
- purely theoretical issues
- cosmetic UI issues
- performance optimizations without safety implications
- feature requests (use issues/PRs instead)

---

## Safe Harbor

Good-faith security research is welcome provided it:
- avoids accessing data you do not own
- avoids interacting with children or child-facing surfaces
- avoids social engineering of users or staff
- avoids disruption of live community services
